      One fine evening in October 2018, WhatsApp notifications showed a new name. Upon enquiry, the client proposed a new deal for which a small bounty was offered as reward (which was never heard of later tho). But even after the project, this client decided to keep in touch with me.

    Silly talks transitioned into deep all-nighters. The conversations never seemed to end, nor did the will to stay close. Sometimes it was just the mere presence. Sometimes it was a long hug. Slowly, but with heavy brainstorming, one thing became clear. Falling for each other without really realising it, is hands down, the best feeling one can experience.

      They say time flies. Yes it flew past, but faster than the speed of light. It's been two years since I met this angel. A ton of memories flood past as I write this. It just feels like a handful of days. <br>
      To all the times we've had together <br>and more to come, <br>To more adventures,<br> To more tears of joy,
      <br>Happy Birthday Angel.<br><br>
      Love,<br>
